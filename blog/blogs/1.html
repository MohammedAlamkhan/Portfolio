        <div class="content">
            <h2>The Promise vs. Reality</h2>
            <p>When Google championed RCS as the future of messaging, they promised an enhanced communication experience. Instead, they've delivered what feels like a supercharged spam channel. My messaging inbox has become a wasteland of promotional content, with personal messages drowning in a sea of corporate noise.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Daily Reality Check:</strong> This morning alone, I received 7 promotional RCS messages from businesses I've never interacted with, compared to just 3 personal messages from actual contacts.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Business Message Invasion</h2>
            <p>Google's "verified business messaging" has become a nightmare. Here's what's really happening:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Businesses are exploiting RCS's rich media features to send what amounts to full-screen ads directly to our message inboxes</li>
                <li>The "verified" status is being handed out too liberally, with minimal vetting of business messaging practices</li>
                <li>"Suggested replies" are nothing more than clickbait buttons designed to engage users in promotional conversations</li>
                <li>There's no effective way to bulk-block promotional messages while keeping personal RCS features enabled</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Verification Facade</h2>
            <p>Google's verification system is a paper tiger. While they claim it prevents spam, the reality is different:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verified businesses can still send unsolicited promotional content</li>
                <li>The verification process focuses on business legitimacy, not messaging practices</li>
                <li>There's no meaningful limit on message frequency or content type</li>
                <li>User consent mechanisms are weak and often buried in fine print</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Dark Patterns</h2>
            <p>RCS business messages employ manipulative tactics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Auto-expanding rich cards that dominate your screen</li>
                <li>Deceptive "urgent" notifications that are just sales pitches</li>
                <li>Persistent notification badges that won't clear until you interact with the message</li>
                <li>Confusing opt-out processes that often lead to more promotional content</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Missing Controls</h2>
            <p>What users desperately need but RCS fails to provide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A separate tab for business messages, completely isolated from personal communications</li>
                <li>One-click permanent blocking of all promotional content</li>
                <li>Clear, universal opt-out mechanisms that actually work</li>
                <li>Granular controls over what types of business messages can reach you</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Way Forward</h2>
            <p>Until Google addresses these issues, I've found these workarounds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Disable RCS completely and use alternative messaging apps for personal communications</li>
                <li>Use a secondary phone number for business contacts to isolate promotional messages</li>
                <li>Enable SMS-only mode when possible, sacrificing features for peace of mind</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>The Bottom Line:</strong> RCS has become a spam-filled mess that prioritizes business interests over user experience. Until Google implements serious changes to message control and promotional content limitations, it's failing at its primary purpose: being a better way to communicate with people who matter to us.</p>
